# Repeated-Huffman-Coding
Huffman coding is a popular algorithm for data compression. 
In this research we used Huffman coding repeatedly for compression and decompression of any type of data. 
After a certain repetition the compressed file will getting larger than it's previous version. 
We will keep the last smallest version of any file.
